Topic 3\n4. Topic 4\n\n\nInitially, give me an overview of every topic and teach me the basics, and tell me everything that gives me enough information in each topic that I can use it to pass my exam.\n\nA VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: Give your explanation mostly in simple English, but use Bangla (বাংলা) to help me understand clearly. Mix both languages naturally so I can learn English terms while truly understanding the concepts in Bangla. And please teach me like I'm a beginner or a child."
